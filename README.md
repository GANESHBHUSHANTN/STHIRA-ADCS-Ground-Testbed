# STHIRA – Modular CubeSat ADCS Ground Test Platform

## Overview
STHIRA is a low-cost, modular ground-based platform to demonstrate
attitude determination, stabilization control, and telemetry
communication for CubeSat-class systems.

## Motivation
Aligned with Indian Navy, ISRO, and DRDO requirements for
indigenous capability building in space systems engineering.

## System Capabilities
- IMU-based attitude sensing
- Sensor fusion (Complementary / Madgwick)
- PID attitude control
- Reaction wheel / magnetorquer demo
- MATLAB–Simulink validated simulation
- SDR-based ground station

## Budget
Prototype cost: ~₹3,000 (student-grade)

## Project Status
Phase 1: Simulation ✔  
Phase 2: Firmware development ⏳  
Phase 3: Hardware integration ⏳  

## Contributors
- Mechanical Engineering (ADCS, Dynamics, CAD)
