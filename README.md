# STHIRA
Modular CubeSat ADCS Ground Test Platform

For SANGAM & INGENIUM
Prayoga '25, NIT Trichy

## Overview
STHIRA is a low-cost, modular ground-based platform to demonstrate
attitude determination, stabilization control, and telemetry
communication for CubeSat-class systems.

## Motivation
Aligned with Indian Navy, ISRO and DRDO requirements for
indigenous capability building in space systems engineering.

## System Capabilities
- IMU-based attitude sensing
- Sensor fusion (Complementary / Madgwick)
- PID attitude control
- Reaction wheel / magnetorquer demo
- MATLAB–Simulink validated simulation
- SDR-based ground station

## Budget
Prototype cost: Approximation as ₹3,871 (Incl misc. expenses & tax)

## Project Status
Phase 1: Simulation
Phase 2: Firmware development   
Phase 3: Hardware integration   

## Timeline Proposition (20 days)

Phase 1: 5 days (0-5)
Phase 2: 10 days (5-15)
         5 days (Code & Repository Deployment)
         2 days (Testing)
         3 days (Hardware Procurement)
Phase 3: 5 days (16-20)
Addn.:   2 days (for misc.) 
(if needed)
